    "# Blind hackathon\n",
    "There are plenty of online tools for biological interpretation available. Most of them carry out functional enrichment of gene groups with particular properties (e.g. common biological pathway). \n",
    "\n",
    "_Why are there so many tools?_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very good question! \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No consensus on the \"best\" algorithm for the enrichment\n",
    "- Additional features like using knowledge about protein-protein interaction networks\n",
    "- Continuously changing knowledgebases\n",
    "- Competition for the most user-friendly and visually appealing framework\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example for enriched KEGG pathway. Proteins/genes of the submitted list are labeled green._\n",
    "![](resources/images/hsa05144.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will look into several online enrichment tools and compare the results. Check out this [tutorial](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/DGE-functional-analysis/lessons/02_functional_analysis.html) for a detailed overview of the methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to spice this exercise up, you get only a data table without further information about the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, this blind hackathon will test the capability of the tools to answer simple questions like \"Which cell type / tissue?\" and \"What the hell happened to these cells?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What will you learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a better feeling into how much you can trust the information obtained from gene set enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get an overview of available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn to use them\n"
